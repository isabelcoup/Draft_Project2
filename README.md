# Draft_Project2


There are 6 .aln files. These are the clustal alignment files that are exported from using clustalw2 in my computer terminal. Each file corresponds to one gene. 

There are 6 .ph files. These are the phylip (newick format) phylogenetic trees that correspond to each gene and alignment.

The project2.ipynb is the jupyter notebook for my project 2.
